ScoringGames
============

The <b>Scoring Games Calculator</b> is a Haskell set of modules to manipulate a new game universe, 
the Scoring Universe, representing games with scores, but which also includes the standard Conway Universe.

This project already includes some game implementations, namely Dots'n'Boxes, Kobber and Diskonnect.

Check the user guide at https://github.com/jpneto/ScoringGames/blob/master/userGuide/userGuide.pdf
for a detailed introduction to this system.

This is still in a beta version.
